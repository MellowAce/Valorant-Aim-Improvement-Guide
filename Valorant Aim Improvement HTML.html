                        Valorant is a team-based first-person hero shooter created and developed by Riot Games. 
                    In Valorant, players play as one of a wide selection of agents, each agent is designed around several countries and 
                        cultures around the world. In the standard game mode of Valorant, players are assigned to either the 
                    attacking or defending team, with each team having five players on it.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In Valorant, aiming is one of the main core mechanics in the game that can easily determine the outcome 
                    of a round. Although abilities do a fantastic job of enhancing the gameplay in VALORANT, aiming is still 
                        an essential mechanic you must master in order to climb the ranks.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If you’re looking to climb up the ranks of VALORANT, you’ll also need to work on your game sense and knowledge 
                    since you can’t reach your aim’s full potential without knowing the terrain. Some players will be naturally gifted 
                        when it comes to aiming, but it’s a muscle reflex at the end of the day, and anyone can improve with enough patience 
                    and practice. As a former Radiant player, i'll provide you with many tips and strategies to improve your aim in order to
                        rank up in Valorant.

                    <p>
                        It may seem obvious, but something as simple as your crosshair may have a significant impact on your aim in Valorant. 
                    Finding a corsshair that best fits for you and how it is designed is important. Choosing a colour that best stands out against 
                        different walls and objects across the variety of maps is especially useful in visibility. As well as reducing the spread 
                    indicator on your crosshair can give better consistency when it comes to spraying or tapping in different situations. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Your crosshair should be small, simplistic, clearly visible, and not distracting. I suggest choosing a static crosshair over 
                    a dynamic crosshair. Every professional player uses a static crosshair because it is less distracting then a dynamic crosshair that 
                        opens up and moves everytime you run or shoot.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Here is a list of some of my favorite crosshairs as a former Radiant Player:

                    Finding the sweet spot on your mouse sensitivity is crucial to improve your aim.
                While it's all well and good to look at what a well-known pro uses and plugging in those 
                    figures, you won't completely feel at ease until you customise yours to fit your needs.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For a guide on everthing regarding this fundamental of aim, ProGuides has an excellent video that explains 
                everything you need to know about different aim styles and how to find and/or perfect your sensitivity.

                <p>
                    There will always be days when you feel rusty, no matter how much you improve your aim. Warming up will assist 
                you in getting into the swing of things by allowing you to avoid sacrificing the opening rounds of your ranking match. 
                    You'll always have a considerable advantage over any player who is playing their first game of the day, because most 
                people leap directly into competitive mode without warming up.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A good way to warmup before hoping into a ranked game is going into The Range. The range offers 4 different types of practice:
                </p>
                <code>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Open Range: Freely explore the entire range and all it has to offer</li>
                        <li>Shooting Test: Test your gun skills with a variety of shooting challenges</li>
                        <li>Spike Planting: Take control of the site, plant the Spike, and defend it until detonation</li>
                        <li>Spike Defuse: Methodically defeat enemies and defuse the Spike before time runs out!</li>
                    </ol>
                </code>
                <p>
                    What I generally like to do to warmup is going into the Shooting Test range and follow my usual warm-up routine. The 
                warm-up routine I generally use consists of the following:
                </p>
                <code>
                    <ul class="settings">
                        <li>Set your range to practice mode on(under the start button) and set settings to no Strafe, Bot Armor OFF and Infinite Ammo ON.</li>
                        <li>Practice flicking and warming up your aim for approx. 5-10 minutes with the settings above.</li>
                        <li>Warmup with weapons such as Vandal/Phantom(preference) and Sherrif.</li>
                        <li>After warming up with practice mode, set your bot speed to HARD, and set a goal that best suits you and your aim. My goal is 15-20 kills on HARD.</li>
                    </ul>
                </code>
                <p>
                    If you prefer an deathmatch style of warming up, deathmatch is also a great tool to use before hopping into ranked. Deathmatch is also one of the best ways to warmup 
                beacuse it lets you work on your crosshair placement while also warming up your aim against other players.

                    Valorant includes a training range for players to hone their talents, but it can only take you so far. These aim trainers include routines 
                and courses aimed at increasing aiming abilities such as tracking, accuracy, and response time. Trainers with dedicated mods for individual games, 
                    such as Valorant, are also available, making them even better because they'll be more similar to the game you've chosen.

                        <p>
                            KovaaK 2.0 is the first Aim Trainer I suggest. One of the most well-known aim trainers on the market is KovaaK 2.0. KovaaK 2.0 comes 
                        pre-loaded with over 4,000 situations and is used by many players in the Valorant pro circuit. It also comes with guided training sessions 
                            and performance analysis features to help new players keep track of their progress. KovaaK's modified Unreal Engine 4 version allows it 
                        to mimic the mechanics of first-person shooters (FPS) like VALORANT. The sole drawback to Kovaak 2.0 is that it is not free, despite the fact 
                            that it is available on discount.

                            Aim Lab is one of the most attractive aim trainers available. Despite the fact that it is still in its early stages of development, it has 
                        amazing features that set it apart from the competition. Aim Lab includes performance tracking, analytics, and machine learning technologies in 
                            addition to all of the training courses and routines. These help Aim Lab figure out what kind of player you are and personalise itself to 
                        help you improve quickly. Aim Lab is presently available on Steam as a free-to-play game, with two supporter bundles available for those who want 
                            to contribute to the game's development.
